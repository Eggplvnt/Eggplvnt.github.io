                <p>
                    Hey! I'm Ilya,
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a senior at Seattle Pacific University, majoring in Computer Science, and I'll be graduating in June 2024. 
                    I stumbled into Computer Science after a break from community college, unsure of my direction. But once I started, 
                    I found it to be a perfect fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Covid pandemic, I found myself surrounded by a diverse group of individuals, including market traders who were 
                    also software engineers. It was within this community that I was encouraged to explore coding. Intrigued by the prospect, 
                    I returned to school, enrolled in introductory classes, and quickly became captivated. Each coding lab presented a 
                    new puzzle to solve, and every topic introduced me to valuable tools for future challenges. This journey culminated in 
                    the completion of my Associates Degree, allowing me to transfer to a University. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While at Seattle Pacific, I made great friends and connected with professors who have helped me grow as a developer, a 
                    person, and a Christian. Through various Computer Science courses, I've expanded my knowledge and pushed myself academically. 
                    While the journey wasn't without its obstacles, I found immense joy and fulfillment in the process. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm eager to see where my future leads and to evolve as a developer in the real world, solving problems, assisting others, 
                    and making a positive impact on the world.

                                hngr is a project i worked on for my Computer Science Capstone senior project. It is a peer-to-peer 
                                restaurant recommendation and review platform. hngr provides a social space for foodies to share and 
                                discover restaurant experiences.

                                On the hngr project, I concentrated on backend development, playing a key role in improving database 
                                capabilities. I implemented features like post creation, restaurant saving, and favoriting, enhancing 
                                user interaction. This experience deepened my proficiency in creating efficient handlers and routes. 
                                Additionally, I gained insights into iOS development, contributing to cross-platform initiatives. 
                                While backend-focused, I also tackled frontend tasks, fostering a holistic understanding of the application. 
                                This allowed me to seamlessly integrate frontend and backend components for a cohesive user experience.

                                In collaboration with a classmate for my Algorithms class, we developed a sophisticated web crawler as 
                                our final project. The program operates by accepting a file containing links to scrape for 'hrefs', along 
                                with a specified depth provided by the user. It meticulously traverses through each link until the designated 
                                depth is attained, starting from the initial links. Upon completion, the program generates an interactive graph 
                                utilizing a powerful Java graph library. Furthermore, it calculates the Closeness Centrality for each node, 
                                presenting the results in descending order. This project not only showcased our adeptness in algorithmic design 
                                but also demonstrated our ability to create impactful solutions for real-world challenges.

                                written in a custom language by our professor, rigorously checks for lexical and syntax errors. After
                                validation, it intelligently converts the program into Prolog or Scheme based on the user's flag. This

                                This project serves as a sophisticated tool for identifying natural languages within text. It's meticulously
                                 crafted with core algorithms that construct a comprehensive word frequency histogram. By leveraging advanced
                                  filtering and bucketing techniques, it efficiently discerns the language of the text. Developed as a project 
                                  for my Data Structures II class.

                        Another project that was done for my Data Structures class. I implemented the code that runs through a 2D 
                        maze to find the correct solution if one exists.

                                The program begins by reading a 2D maze file and converts it into a matrix format. It then traverses 
                                the maze from a predefined starting point, diligently exploring every possible path to find the correct 
                                route that leads to the maze's exit, confirming its solvability. Throughout its execution, the program 
                                visually illustrates its journey through the maze, pausing to highlight the final, correct path once it's 
                                identified.
